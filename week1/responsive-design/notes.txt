Responsive Web Design
    - Making your site look good on ANY device
    - It's not just size, but device capabilities matter as well (caniuse.com)

Devices
    - Touch vs Mouse/keyboard interaction
    - Size / Pixel density
    - Speed / device capability / hardware
    - Mobile browser quirks
    - Accessibility ( alt text )
    - Network speed
    - File downloads

Serving a different mobile site
    - m.reddit.com / mobile.nytime.com
    - Outdated!
    - 2 code bases, 2x html, 2x css

We need to make our CSS responsive
    - media queries
        - @media (min-width:600px) {}
        - allow us to apply CSS based on different conditions
    - Mobile first development
        - developing your mobile site first!
        - You can focus on giving the people that come to your site a robust and complete mobile experience
            - Progressive enhancement
                - As our device size grows, we can change the layout / add new UI elements
                - Antithesis of Graceful Degradation

CSS
    - Units
        - px    - fixed, least flexible unit in css
        - %     - much more flexible than pixels, typically refer to parent elements
        - em    - refer to the width of the 'm' character of the parent element - ratio.  2em => 2x width m
        - rem   - refer to the width of the 'm' character of the html element - ratio. ems/rems are mostly used in padding / margin becuase they often look nice when spacing text
        - vw    - are a % of the view width - the width of the browser window / viewable area. 100vw would be 100% of the view width in the browser
        - vh    - are a % of the view height - the height of the window / viewable area
        - in / cm  - might be interpreted in a janky way by most devices - work well for print css
